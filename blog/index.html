            <p>I tried to make my assignment look organized. I also wanted to incorporate as much elements as I could into the site from the lectures we've had this week. I didn't think this assignment took too long for me to finish, but I did come across a few problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>I had some trouble with getting my image to work on the site. After some time, I realized that I forgot to change the permissions on the image file.Eventually I got it fixed.</p></li>
                <li><p>I was also a little confused on where to make the blog.html. Since we're supposed to update the blog for every assignment, I didn't see why we had to only include it into the assignment-1 folder. Wouldn't that mean we'd have to access the assignment 1 folder each time we want to update the blog? I plan on asking a TA or Professor Hess about this.</p></li>
                <li><p>I'm still adjusting to this setup of turning in assignments, it's slightlly different from how we did things in the previous CS16X classes. However, as I use Git and GitHub more often I'm starting to really like how I can immediately backup a copy of my code somewhere else.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite this, I'm really excited to finally learn how to develop websites. I've been wanting to focus on Web and App Development when I get into pro-school, but I wanted to know firsthand what it's like to develop them before sticking with that plan.</p>
            <p>I also really like how we get to make our own blogs to record our progress. I love to type but never knew what to type besides code, so this is great opportunity for me to develop something that doesn't require much effort. It's actually pretty relaxing.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I want to make this blog look a bit prettier in the future. Potentially applying more lessons to this blog. Well, that's all for this entry, until the next one. Ciao!</p>

            <h3 class="date">22 April 2019</h3>
            <p>Some of the challenges I faced were aligning the twits into 3 columns. I played Flexbox Froggy to help me understand how to use flexboxes and it helped me align the boxes in the way I wanted them to be. Another issue I encountered was using all of the classes in the html file, because there were some that I didn't need to use. </p>
            <p>I learned how to make the twits into columns, even tho they aren't exactly perfect. I also learned how I can put lists into rows instead of columns. There wasn't a mindblowing insight that I discovered but using the inspector really helped to find boxes and their dimensions. It helped me determine changes and measurements when it came to margins and paddings for each box.</p>
            <p>Random FYI, pastel pink is my favorite color as you can tell by the page. Some of the things I had to Google were Flexbox Froggy, and "how to have 3 columns of items". But for the most part I just played around with flexboxes until I got what I wanted, and that game helped me more than looking up specific problems that I want solutions to.</p>
            <p>Overall, this assignments took way longer than I expected. Which made me realize that I liked developing more than designing applications. I never knew how skilled you'd actually have to be to design a website, and this assignment gave me a little insight on design. Other than that, I really enjoyed this assignments (especially since I can color everything pink now).</p>

            <h3 class="date">13 May 2019</h3>
            <p>I ended up not finishing this assignment, mainly because I underestimated the assignment. I didn't advance much on the assignment, I waited too long to actually start it. Completely my fault, I bit off more than I can chew.</p>
            <p>I did Google some information about the classList function and what it actually did, along with the toggle function that was in one of the demo code for the box lecture.</p>
            <p>Even though I didn't finish the assignment, I learned that I shouldn't be so cocky and expect myself to finish a project in a short time just because I "understood" the concept of some functions. I ended up not feeling as proud as I thought I would with this assignment, but that's entirely my fault.</p>

            <h3 class="date">20 May 2019</h3>
            <p>Some of the challenges I faced were reading in the urls and getting the root '/' to route to 'index.html' rather than say the page was missing. At first I went with a simple condition to signalize that if '/' was typed then run the code for 'index.html', but for some reason that didn't work. Next, I was about to implement an array of urls to see if it would make it easier.</p>
            <p>But, I went in for my demo with TA Braden, and he showed me something much simplier than making an array. My code was finally complete, and I was surprised that I managed to finish this assignment within a day. Especially since I was discouraged from the previous one.</p>
            <p>I spent the whole afternoon in office hours today, and TA Akshay really helped me understand what we had to do and how to use readFile(), and how to cache memory. There were around 5 other students that were in the room besides the I and Ashkay. It was a bit cramped, but we were all comfortable with each other and helped each other out when we didn't understand how to do certain things.</p>
            <p>I think Friday was the most fulfilling I've ever felt when it came to working on something. It felt good and I learned a lot, and I actually got something done. I was a bit nervous about this assignment, but in the end it wasn't too bad.</p>
            <p>Overall, this assignment was actually pretty short. Well, shorter than the previous assignments. It went a lot faster, might've been because of my peers' help.</p>
